      <h3>Diving</h3>
      <p>
        The crystal clear, bright blue waters around the island turn it into a paradise for divers. The waters stay clear thanks to the filtering properties of lime stone and a rich underwater fauna. It is not uncommon to have a visibility range of 165 to 200 feet (50 – 60 meters). We will organize exclusive diving tours for you, from beginners‘ to professional level. Just ask us. – we also offer individual reef diving, steep face diving and more.
